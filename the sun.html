    the sun
</h2>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium, with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron
        The Sun's core is thought to be composed primarily of an ionized gas known as plasma, which emits light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation through nuclear fusion reactions in which hydrogen nuclei are combined to form helium nuclei. This nuclear fusion generates enormous amounts of energy in the form of gamma rays and other forms of radiation which are then radiated outward from the core through a series of radiative zones and convective zones to the photosphere where it escapes into space as sunlight or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The temperature at the core is estimated to be around 15 million Kelvin (27 million degrees Fahrenheit).

            The Sun's atmosphere has several layers: an outermost layer called the corona; an intermediate layer called the chromosphere; and an innermost layer called the photosphere. The photosphere is what we see when we look at a picture or photograph taken from space or from Earth's surface; it appears as a bright disk surrounded by a faint halo due to its interaction with Earth's atmosphere. The chromosphere lies just above it and contains hot gases that emit light in various colors due to their temperatures; these colors can be seen during solar eclipses when they are visible against a dark sky background. The corona extends outwards from this region and can reach temperatures up to several million Kelvin (several million degrees Fahrenheit).
            
            The Sun also has several distinct features such as sunspots, solar flares, prominences, filaments and coronal holes which are all associated with magnetic fields generated by its internal convection currents. Sunspots are dark regions on its surface caused by intense magnetic fields which inhibit convection currents in those areas; they appear darker because they are cooler than their surroundings due to their reduced heat output from inhibited convection currents. Solar flares are sudden bursts of energy released from sunspots due to magnetic reconnection events; they can cause radio blackouts on Earth if they occur near our planet's magnetic field lines. Prominences are large loops or arches extending outwards from sunspots due to intense magnetic fields; they can last for days or weeks before dissipating back into space again. Filaments are long strands or ribbons extending outwards from sunspots due to intense magnetic fields; they appear darker than their surroundings because they contain cooler material than their surroundings due to inhibited convection currents within them. Coronal holes are regions where there is less material than usual in comparison with their surroundings; these regions appear darker because there is less heat output from them due to inhibited convection currents within them compared with their surroundings. 
            
            The Sun also has an 11-year cycle known as the solar cycle during which its activity varies between periods known as solar maximums (when activity
            The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (865,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.

            The Sun's core is thought to be composed primarily of an ionized gas known as plasma, which emits light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation through nuclear fusion reactions. These reactions convert hydrogen into helium in a process known as nuclear fusion or thermonuclear fusion. This releases energy in the form of gamma rays, which are then converted into visible light as they interact with the surrounding plasma. The core temperature of the Sun has been estimated to be approximately 15 million Kelvin (15 million degrees Celsius).
            
            The outer layers of the Sun exhibit differential rotation: at the equator the surface rotates once every 25–35 days; near the poles it rotates once every 36–53 days. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and an associated angular momentum transfer from the interior to the exterior layers. The differential rotation flattens out at greater distances from the equator and eventually gives way to uniform rotation in its outermost layers.
            
            The Sun's magnetic field extends well beyond its visible surface and extends out into space forming what is known as interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The IMF affects all planets in our Solar System including Earth and influences their atmospheres and magnetospheres. The IMF also affects cosmic rays entering our Solar System from interstellar space which can cause auroras on Earth when they interact with our planet's atmosphere and magnetic field
